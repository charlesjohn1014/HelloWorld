*.javadoc.jar files
----------------
To generate the full javaDoc, simply double-click on the <your_file>.javadoc.jar

NOTE : If the double-click do not work, this is due to the fact that the .jar
file type is not associated to java (.exe). In that case, you can simply 
open a console, cd to this directory and type 'java -jar <your_file>.javadoc.jar.jar
This is assuming that java(.exe) is known by your os. If this is not the case,
you can try by specifying the full path to java.
The extraction will create a sub-directory named <your_file>.javadoc.
You will be able to browse the java doc starting from <your_file>.javadoc/index.html
